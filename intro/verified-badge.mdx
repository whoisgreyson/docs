We believe that high-profile accounts originating from prominent communities or events within our server deserve their own recognition on the `/whois` command. Moreover, we believe this badge symbolises their notable significance within the community.

| Selection   | Candidates are selected by the management team after they have demonstrated a relevance to our community and their commitment has been brought to the attention of a Manager. |
| Application | Management discusses the candidacy and, if approved, the badge will be reflected on the account's whois profile.                                                              |

The process to acquire the badge is thorough and strenuous to ensure the authenticity and value of the badge is maintained. This ensures the badge holds its recognition and merit when seen on the whois command.

<Warning>
  To ensure the authenticity and merit of the verified badge, it is not available for purchase, request, or nomination. It is governed by the Management team.
